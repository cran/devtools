#' Replacement version of system.file
#'
#' This function is meant to intercept calls to \code{\link[base]{system.file}},
#' so that it behaves well with packages loaded by devtools. It is made
#' available when a package is loaded with \code{\link{load_all}}.
#'
#' When \code{system.file} is called from the R console (the global
#' envrironment), this function detects if the target package was loaded with
#' \code{\link{load_all}}, and if so, it uses a customized method of searching
#' for the file. This is necessary because the directory structure of a source
#' package is different from the directory structure of an installed package.
#'
#' When a package is loaded with \code{load_all}, this function is also inserted
#' into the package's imports environment, so that calls to \code{system.file}
#' from within the package namespace will use this modified version. If this
#' function were not inserted into the imports environment, then the package
#' would end up calling \code{base::system.file} instead.
