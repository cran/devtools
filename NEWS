devtools 0.2
------------

* `install_github` now uses `RCurl` instead of external `wget` to retrieve
  package. This should make it more robust wrt external dependencies.

* `load_all` will skip missing files with a warning (thanks to suggestion from Jeff Laake)

* `check` automatically deletes `.Rcheck` directory on successful completion

* Quote the path to R so it works even if there are spaces in the path.

devtools 0.1
------------

* Check for presence of `DESCRIPTION` when loading packages to avoid false
  positives

* `install` now works correctly with `devel_mode` to install packages in your
  development library

* `release` prints news so you can more easily check it

* All `R CMD xxx` functions now use the current R, not the first R found on
  the system path.
