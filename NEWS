devtools 0.1
------------

* Check for presence of `DESCRIPTION` when loading packages to avoid false
  positives

* `install` now works correctly with `devel_mode` to install packages in your
  development library

* `release` prints news so you can more easily check it

* All `R CMD xxx` functions now use the current R, not the first R found on
  the system path.
