devtools 0.5.1
--------------

* Fix error in that was causing R commands to fail on windows.

devtools 0.5
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS

* new `show_rd` function that will show the development version of a help
  file.

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* external R commands always run in locale `C`, because that's what the CRAN
  severs do.

* `clean_source` sources an R script into a fresh R environment, ensuring that
  it can run independently of your current working environment. Optionally
  (`vanilla = T`), it will source in a vanilla R environment which ignores all
  local environment settings.

* On windows, `devtools` will also add the path to `mingw` on startup. (Thanks
  to pointer from Dave Lovell)

devtools 0.4
------------

NEW FUNCTIONS

* new `wd` function to change the working directory to a package subdirectory.

* `check_doc` now checks package documentation as a whole, in the same way
  that `R CMD check` does, rather than low-level syntax checking, which is
  done by `roxygen2. DESCRIPTION checking has been moved into `load_all`.
  `check_rd` has been removed.

* `build` is now exported, and defaults to building in the package's parent
  directory. It also gains a new `binary` parameter controls whether a binary
  or a source version (with no vignettes or manuals) is built. Confusingly,
  binary packages are built with `R CMD INSTALL`.

* `build_win` sends your package to the R windows builder, allowing you to
  make a binary version of your package for windows users if you're using
  linux or a max (if you're using windows already, use `build(binary = T)`)

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* if using `.Rpackages` config file, default function is used last, not first.

* on Windows, `devtools` now checks for the presence of `Rtools` on startup,
  and will automatically add it to the path if needed.

* `document` uses `roxygen2` instead of `roxygen`. It now loads package
  dependency so that they're available when roxygen executes the package
  source code.

* `document` has new parameter `clean` which clears all roxygen caches and
  removes all existing man files. `check` now runs `document` in this mode.

* `dev_mode` will create directories recursively, and complain if it can't
  create them.  It should also work better on windows.

* `install_github` now allows you to specify which branch to download, and
  automatically reloads package if needed.

* `reload` now will only reload if the package is already loaded.

* `release` gains `check` parameter that allows you to skip package check (if
  you've just done it.)

* `test` automatically reloads code so you never run tests on old code 

devtools 0.3
------------

* new `bash()` function that starts bash shell in package directory. Useful if
  you want to use git etc.

* removed inelegant `update_src()` since now superseded by `bash()`

* fix bug in ftp upload that was adding extraneous space

* `build` function builds package in specified directory. `install`, `check`
  and `release` now all use this function.

* `build`, `install`, `check` and `release` better about cleaning up after
  themselves - always try to both work in session temporary directory and
  delete any files/directories that they create

devtools 0.2
------------

* `install_github` now uses `RCurl` instead of external `wget` to retrieve
  package. This should make it more robust wrt external dependencies.

* `load_all` will skip missing files with a warning (thanks to suggestion from Jeff Laake)

* `check` automatically deletes `.Rcheck` directory on successful completion

* Quote the path to R so it works even if there are spaces in the path.

devtools 0.1
------------

* Check for presence of `DESCRIPTION` when loading packages to avoid false
  positives

* `install` now works correctly with `devel_mode` to install packages in your
  development library

* `release` prints news so you can more easily check it

* All `R CMD xxx` functions now use the current R, not the first R found on
  the system path.
