check_man(pkg = ".")

\item{pkg}{package description, can be path or package name.  See
\code{\link{as.package}} for more information}

\value{
Nothing. This function is called purely for it's side effects: if
}
\description{
This function attempts to run the documentation related checks in the
same way that \code{R CMD check} does. Unfortunately it can't run them
all because some tests require the package to be loaded, and the way
they attempt to load the code conflicts with how devtools does it.
