\item{on}{turn dev mode on (\code{TRUE}) or off (\code{FALSE}).  If omitted will guess
based on whether or not \code{path} is in \code{\link[=.libPaths]{.libPaths()}}}

We no longer recommend \code{dev_mode()} and it will be removed in a future
release of devtools. Instead, we now rely on \code{\link[=load_all]{load_all()}} to test drive an
in-development package. If you really like the idea of corralling
experimental packages in a special library, you might enjoy
\code{withr::local_libpaths()}. If you are concerned about different projects
interfering with each other through the use of a shared library, consider
using the \href{https://rstudio.github.io/renv/}{renv package}.

Original description: When activated, \code{dev_mode} creates a new library for
storing installed packages. This new library is automatically created when
\code{dev_mode} is activated if it does not already exist. This allows you to test
development packages in a sandbox, without interfering with the other
packages you have installed.
