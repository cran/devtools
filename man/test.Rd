\title{Execute all \pkg{test_that} tests in a package.}
\usage{
test(pkg = ".", filter = NULL, ...)

uses_testthat(pkg = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{package description, can be path or package name. See
\code{\link{as.package}} for more information}

\item{filter}{If not \code{NULL}, only tests with file names matching this
regular expression will be executed.  Matching will take on the file
name after it has been stripped of \code{"test-"} and \code{".r"}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[testthat]{test_dir}}}
}
\description{
Tests are assumed to be located in either the \code{inst/tests/} or
\code{tests/testthat} directory (the latter is recommended).
See \code{\link[testthat]{test_dir}} for the naming convention of test
scripts within one of those directories and
\code{\link[testthat]{test_check}} for the folder structure conventions.
}
\details{
If no testing infrastructure is present
(detected by the \code{uses_testthat} function), you'll be asked if you want
devtools to create it for you (in interactive sessions only). See
\code{\link{add_test_infrastructure}} for more details.
