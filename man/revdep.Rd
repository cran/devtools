\title{Reverse dependency tools.}
\usage{
revdep(pkg, dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests", "LinkingTo"),
  recursive = FALSE, ignore = NULL, bioconductor = FALSE)

revdep_maintainers(pkg = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Package name. This is unlike most devtools packages which
take a path because you might want to determine dependencies for a package
that you don't have installed. If omitted, defaults to the name of the
current package.}

\item{dependencies}{A character vector listing the types of dependencies
to follow.}

\item{recursive}{If \code{TRUE} look for full set of recusive dependencies.}

\item{ignore}{A character vector of package names to ignore. These packages
will not appear in returned vector. This is used in
\code{\link{revdep_check}} to avoid packages with installation problems
or extremely long check times.}

\item{bioconductor}{If \code{TRUE} also look for dependencies amongst
bioconductor packages.}
}
\description{
Tools to check and notify maintainers of all CRAN and bioconductor
packages that depend on the specified package.
}
\details{
The first run in a session will be time-consuming because it must download
all package metadata from CRAN and bioconductor. Subsequent runs will
be faster.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
revdep("ggplot2")

revdep("ggplot2", ignore = c("xkcd", "zoo"))
}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{revdep_check}()} to run R CMD check on all reverse
  dependencies.
