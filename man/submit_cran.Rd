\usage{
submit_cran(pkg = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{package description, can be path or package name.  See
\code{\link{as.package}} for more information}
}
\description{
This uses the new CRAN web-form submission process. After submission, you
will recieve an email asking you to confirm submission - this is used
to check that the package is submitted by the maintainer.
}
\details{
It's recommend that you use \code{\link{release}()} rather than this
function as it performs more checks prior to submission.
