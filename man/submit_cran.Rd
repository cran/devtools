\description{
This uses the new CRAN web-form submission process. After submission, you
will receive an email asking you to confirm submission - this is used
to check that the package is submitted by the maintainer.
}
\details{
It's recommended that you use \code{\link[=release]{release()}} rather than this
function as it performs more checks prior to submission.
