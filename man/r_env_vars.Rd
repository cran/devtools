\description{
Devtools sets a number of environmental variables to ensure consistent
between the current R session and the new session, and to ensure that
everything behaves the same across systems. It also suppresses a common
warning on windows, and sets \code{NOT_CRAN} so you can tell that your
code is not running on CRAN. If \code{NOT_CRAN} has been set externally, it
is not overwritten.
