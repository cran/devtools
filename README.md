The aim of devtools is to make package development easier by providing R
functions that simplify and expedite common tasks. [R
Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) is a book based around this workflow.

## Installation

```r
# Install devtools from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
```

## Usage

All devtools functions accept a path as an argument, e.g.
`load_all("path/to/mypkg")`. If you don't specify a path, devtools will
look in the current working directory - this is recommended practice.

### Frequent development tasks:

* `load_all()` simulates installing and reloading your package, loading R code
  in `R/`, compiled shared objects in `src/` and data files in `data/`. During
  development you usually want to access all functions (even un-exported
  internal ones) so `load_all()` works as if all functions were exported in the
  package `NAMESPACE`.

* `document()` updates generated documentation in `man/`, file collation and
  `NAMESPACE`.

* `test()` reloads your code with `load_all()`, then runs all `testthat` tests.

* `test_coverage()` runs test coverage on your package with
  [covr](https://github.com/r-lib/covr). This makes it easy to see what parts of your
  package could use more tests!

### Building and installing:

* `install()` reinstalls the package, detaches the currently loaded version
  then reloads the new version with `library()`. Reloading a package is not
  guaranteed to work: see the documentation for `unload()` for caveats.

* `build()` builds a package file from package sources. You can use it to build
  a binary version of your package.

* `install_*` functions install an R package:
   * `install_github()` from GitHub
   * `install_gitlab()` from GitLab
   * `install_bitbucket()` from Bitbucket
   * `install_url()` from an arbitrary url
   * `install_git()` and `install_svn()` from an arbitrary git or SVN repository
   * `install_local()` from a local file on disk
   * `install_version()` from a specific version on CRAN

* `update_packages()` updates a package to the latest version. This works
  both on packages installed from CRAN as well as those installed from any of
  the `install_*` functions.

### Check and release:

* `check()` updates the documentation, then builds and checks the package locally.
  `check_win()` checks a package using
  [win-builder](http://win-builder.r-project.org/), and `check_rhub()` checks a package using
  [r-hub](http://log.r-hub.io/). This allows you to easily check
  your package on all systems CRAN uses before submission.

* `release()` makes sure everything is ok with your package (including asking
  you a number of questions), then builds and uploads to CRAN.

## Learning more

R package development can be intimidating, however there are now a number of
valuable resources to help!

<a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/"><img src="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/cover.png" height="252" align = "right"/></a>

1. [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) gives a comprehensive
   treatment of all common parts of package development and uses devtools
   throughout. The [Package
   structure](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html) chapter is a great place to get started
   understanding the parts of a package and how they work together.

2. [RStudio community - package
   development](https://community.rstudio.com/c/package-development)
   is a great place to ask specific questions related to package development.

3. [rOpenSci packages](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/) has
   extensive documentation on best practices for R packages looking to be
   contributed to rOpenSci, but also very useful general recommendations
   for package authors.

4. There are a number of fantastic blog posts on writing your first package, including
   - [Writing an R package from scratch - Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
   - [How to develop good R packages - MaÃ«lle Salmon](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/)

5. [Writing R

   the exhaustive, canonical reference for writing R packages, maintained by
   the R core developers.

## Conscious uncoupling

devtools started off as a lean-and-mean package to facilitate local package
development, but over the years it accumulated more and more functionality.
Currently devtools is undergoing a [conscious
uncoupling](https://web.archive.org/web/20140326060230/http://www.goop.com/journal/be/conscious-uncoupling)
to split out functionality into smaller, more tightly focussed packages. This
includes:

* [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat): Writing and running tests
  (i.e. `test()`).

* [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen): Function and package documentation
  (i.e. `document()`).

* [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes): Installing packages (i.e.
  `install_github()`).

* [pkgbuild](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgbuild): Building binary packages
  (including checking if build tools are available) (i.e. `build()`).

* [pkgload](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload): Simulating package loading (i.e.
  `load_all()`).

* [rcmdcheck](https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck): Running R CMD check and
  reporting the results (i.e. `check()`).

* [revdepcheck](https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck): Running R CMD check on
  all reverse dependencies, and figuring out what's changed since the last CRAN
  release (i.e. `revdep_check()`).

* [sessioninfo](https://github.com/r-lib/sessioninfo): R session info (i.e.
  `session_info()`).

* [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis): Automating package setup (i.e.
  `use_test()`).

Generally, you should not need to worry about these different packages, because
devtools installs them all automatically. You will need to care, however, if
you're filing a bug because reporting it at the correct place will lead to a
speedier resolution.
